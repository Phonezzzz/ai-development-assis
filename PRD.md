- Success criteria: Mock image generation works, images can be saved to project workspace

**Workspace Mode**
- Functionality: File management, project overview, and code editing simulation
- Purpose: Centralized project management and file organization
- Trigger: Mode selector switch to "Workspace" 
- Progression: Project view → File selection → Code display → Edit simulation → Save
- Success criteria: Files can be uploaded, organized, and edited with syntax highlighting

**Voice Input & Synthesis**
- Functionality: Browser-based speech recognition and text-to-speech output
- Purpose: Hands-free interaction and accessibility
- Trigger: Voice button press or continuous listening mode
- Progression: Voice activation → Speech recognition → Text conversion → Agent response → TTS output
- Success criteria: Voice input converts to text accurately, responses are spoken aloud

**Agent System Workflow**
- Functionality: Four-agent system (Planner → Worker → Supervisor → Error Fixer) with visible workflow
- Purpose: Demonstrate sophisticated AI collaboration and quality control
- Trigger: "Plan" or "Act" mode selection
- Progression: User request → Planner analysis → Worker execution → Supervisor review → Error fixing → Completion
- Success criteria: Each agent's role is clearly displayed, workflow progresses logically, results are high-quality

**Drag & Drop File Handling**
- Functionality: Upload and process various file types with preview and parsing
- Purpose: Easy project file integration and content analysis
- Trigger: File drag onto interface or file picker
- Progression: File drop → Type detection → Preview generation → Content parsing → Workspace integration
- Success criteria: Multiple file types supported, previews accurate, content extractable

## Edge Case Handling

- **Voice Recognition Failure**: Fallback to text input with clear error messaging
- **Unsupported File Types**: Graceful handling with format suggestions and conversion options
- **Agent System Conflicts**: Supervisor override mechanism with user notification
- **Network Simulation Delays**: Loading states and progress indicators for all simulated operations
- **Mobile Voice Input**: Touch-friendly voice controls with visual feedback
- **Large File Uploads**: Progress tracking and chunked processing simulation

## Design Direction

The design should evoke a sense of cutting-edge technological sophistication while remaining approachable and intuitive - think Perplexity AI meets VSCode with a focus on dark themes that reduce eye strain during extended development sessions. The interface should feel rich and feature-complete rather than minimal, showcasing the full capabilities of the agent system.

## Color Selection

Custom palette with a dark foundation and strategic purple accents
- The dark theme reduces visual fatigue during extended coding sessions while purple accents convey innovation and AI sophistication, creating visual hierarchy for important actions and agent states.

- **Primary Color**: Deep purple `oklch(0.45 0.15 285)` - Represents AI intelligence and primary actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Dark slate `oklch(0.15 0.02 240)` for backgrounds, charcoal `oklch(0.25 0.05 245)` for cards
- **Accent Color**: Bright purple `oklch(0.65 0.25 285)` for CTAs, active states, and agent indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Dark Slate `oklch(0.15 0.02 240)`): Light text `oklch(0.9 0.05 280)` - Ratio 12.5:1 ✓
  - Card (Charcoal `oklch(0.25 0.05 245)`): Light text `oklch(0.9 0.05 280)` - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Purple `oklch(0.45 0.15 285)`): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 6.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Purple `oklch(0.65 0.25 285)`): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey technical precision and modern sophistication, using Inter for its excellent readability in UI contexts and optimal rendering across all screen sizes and weights.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Agent Names): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Messages): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Code (Syntax): JetBrains Mono Regular/14px/monospace spacing
  - UI Labels: Inter Medium/14px/tight spacing

## Animations

Animations should feel purposeful and sophisticated, emphasizing the AI's intelligence through smooth, physics-based transitions that guide attention without being distracting during focused work sessions.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth agent transitions convey intelligence, voice waveforms show active listening, file upload progress indicates processing capability
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Agent workflow gets primary animation focus, secondary UI interactions use subtle micro-animations, background processes have minimal visual distraction

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Dialog for agent details, Card for message bubbles and file previews, Tabs for mode switching, Button with loading states for actions, Input with voice integration, Sidebar for navigation, Progress for file operations, Avatar for agent identities
- **Customizations**: Voice waveform visualizer, code syntax highlighter, file drag zone, agent workflow stepper, message timeline
- **States**: Buttons show loading/processing, inputs highlight during voice recognition, agents display active/thinking/complete states
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for voice (Microphone), files (File), agents (Robot), modes (Chat, Image, Code)
- **Spacing**: Consistent 1rem base unit, 0.5rem for tight spacing, 2rem for section separation
- **Mobile**: Collapsible sidebar, touch-friendly voice controls, swipe navigation between modes, responsive agent workflow display
